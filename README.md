"In this module, you will each have to deliver an hybrid application (Android at least (APK)) involving a Backend.
The application must be working (Donâ€™t forget to sign it !!) .
The application must involve at least :
- User authentification
- Push notifications (Machine to Machine push will be more considered than simple push from Firebase or OneSignal backend)
- Usage of a native feature from the phone
- Usage of a custom API will be considered

Application addressing real problematics will be more considered than another todoApp.
